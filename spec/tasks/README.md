# Tasks Directory

## Rules
- **8-12 tasks MAX**
- If it doesn't demo → it's not a task
- If a task feels big → split or delete
- If >12 tasks → you already lost

## Task Template

Each task file (e.g., `01-init-project.md`) must contain:

```markdown
## Task X — Name

### Input
- What already exists

### Output
- What must exist after

### Success Criteria
- How you know it's done
```

## Example Task Structure
```
01-init-project.md
02-core-api.md
03-ui-shell.md
04-main-flow.md
05-integration.md
06-demo-fallback.md
```

**Purpose:** Tasks define scope. They are atomic, have stop conditions, and prevent drift.
